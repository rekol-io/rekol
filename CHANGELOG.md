## [Unreleased]
### Added
- Open-source scaffolding: Apache-2.0 license, README, CONTRIBUTING, Code of
  Conduct, issue/PR templates.
- Quality gate: Ruff (lint+format), mypy, pre-commit, GitHub Actions CI.

### Changed
- Rebranded the project from `memory-tools` to **REKOL**: the Python package is
  now `rekol`, and the formerly separate `memory-*` console scripts are unified
  under a single `rekol` command (`rekol search`, `rekol index`, `rekol capture`,
  `rekol import`, etc.). Docs, hooks, skill, and templates are rebranded to match.
- The data-directory env var is now `REKOL_HOME`. `MEMORY_HOME` is still accepted
  as a fallback, so existing installs keep working without changes.

### Fixed
- `rekol search` crash on queries containing FTS5 operator characters
  (e.g. hyphens) — queries are now sanitized into safe FTS5 phrases.
